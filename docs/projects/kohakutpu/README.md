# KohakuTPU

A tensor accelerator built on KohakuAccel. Two compute units — a matmul cluster
and a vector core — a number format designed around a DSP48E2, an instruction set
spent on that datapath, and a compiler that plans against the machine's own
capacities.

**Device: `xcvu13p-fhgb2104-2L-e`.** Every measurement in these pages was taken on
that part, and they describe *this* accelerator rather than the framework
([results.md](results.md) §1).

KohakuTPU is the framework's worked example. It is the reason the framework's
interfaces are the shape they are, it is where a second project looks to see how
the first one solved something, and it is the evidence that a compute unit written
against the port contract actually closes timing on a real device.

## 1. What it computes

`C = A · B` in **MXFP7**: a 7-bit signed significand with an E5M3 scale shared by
a block of 32, multiplied inside DSP48E2s and reduced as exact integers, with
floating point reached once per 32 MACs. Operands and results in memory are FP16;
the internal format is never visible to software.

| | |
|---|---|
| element format | int7 significand + E5M3 scale per 32 along K |
| tensor CU | 4x8x4 — 64 DSP48E2, 128 MAC/cycle |
| cluster | 4 tensor CUs + 1 accumulator — 4x32x4, **512 MAC/cycle** |
| accumulate | `S1 E7 M14` (FP22), one add per 32 multiplies |
| supported shape | `M = 4a`, `N = 4b`, `K = 32c` |
| vector core | 16 lanes of E8M15, three DSPs each, four transcendentals at full rate |

The whole machine is **AMP FP16-MXFP7**, so the throughput unit is FLOPS rather
than IOPS: the integer datapath is an implementation of a floating-point multiply
whose exponent has been factored out of the block.

## 2. What it demonstrates

**That a compute unit can be almost all datapath.** Every MAC is 0 LUT, 0 FF, 1
DSP — the multiply and the whole K=32 reduction happen inside the DSPs. Against
the FP8 design it replaced, the same 128 MACs cost 1,188 LUT instead of 12,731,
and essentially all of the difference is accumulation leaving the fabric
([results.md](results.md) §7).

**That the framework's port contract is enough to feed one.** A cluster attaches
with a single mesh port. It works because the resident output tile creates enough
operand reuse to bring the demand under one word per cycle — which is an
arithmetic property of the datapath, not a concession the framework made
([accumulator.md](accumulator.md) §1).

**That the layering pays for itself.** One `GEMM` flit becomes 256 accumulator
commands; one `FILL` flit becomes 128 response flits; four flits become a whole
matmul ([isa.md](isa.md) §8).

**That the thing that limits a dataflow machine is usually not what it looks
like.** Three separate times a measurement pointed at bandwidth and was wrong, and
the machine went from 6.8% of its own datapath peak to 87.6% without widening a
single bus ([results.md](results.md) §8).

### 2.1 Two units, one port — and nothing else in common

This is the project's strongest single piece of evidence about the framework, and
it is an argument about *flexibility* rather than about fit. KohakuTPU contains
two compute units. They are the same shape at exactly one place: the mesh port.

| | matmul cluster | vector core |
|---|---|---|
| operand memory width | **928 bits** | **256 bits** |
| operand memories | **two** (`u_l1a`, `u_l1b` — A and B are separate RAMs) | **one** flat scratchpad |
| memories in the unit | **five** L1-class RAMs: two per manager plus each node's own accumulator tile | operand L1, an instruction memory in distributed LUTRAM, and a register file mirrored three times to synthesise three read ports |
| read latency | 1 on L1, **2** on the accumulator tile | 1, and the walk derives from the primitive rather than assuming it |
| what an instruction is | a macro-op — one flit becomes hundreds of internal commands | a program — words loaded into instruction memory, then entered |
| element format | int7 with a shared block scale | E8M15 |

**Both plug into the identical mesh port.** The framework fixed *how a unit
receives work and returns results* and nothing else; everything behind that
boundary diverged completely, down to the number of memories, their widths, their
primitives and their latencies.

So none of the structure on these pages should be read as "the way a compute unit
is built". A 928-bit L1 with a separate A and B RAM is what a DSP cascade eating
eight operand words per cycle needs; a 256-bit flat scratchpad is what a 16-lane
SIMD core needs. **They are two answers, not one pattern**, and the fact that both
answers reached the mesh through the same six signals is what the framework is
claiming.

## 3. Which framework features it exercises

| framework | how KohakuTPU uses it |
|---|---|
| [compute-unit port](../../spec/compute-unit-port.md) | two unit types on the same contract — a cluster and a vector core, one with a macro-op and one with a program |
| [instruction payload](../../spec/instruction-encoding.md) | three cluster opcodes in a 256-bit payload; 32-bit vector words, eight per payload, inside a load-and-run envelope |
| [flit format](../../spec/flit-format.md) | operand words sized so 32 int7 elements plus 4 scales fill the payload exactly |
| [memory protocol](../../spec/memory-protocol.md) | streaming descriptors, out-of-order tagged responses, burst writes, and a per-request quantise flag |
| [memory agent](../../arch/mas/README.md) | KohakuTPU's own quantiser sits in its read path and on its upload path |
| [mesh](../../arch/noc/README.md) | unit-to-unit bulk transfer, used for peer accumulation at full accumulator width |
| [ship assembly](../../arch/ship/README.md) | four independent meshes, one per SLR, joined by the interlink |
| [measurement flow](../../workflow/measure.md) | every figure in [results.md](results.md) |

### 3.1 Which category is which

The tree distinguishes four kinds of thing, and a project page is only useful if
it says which kind each of its subjects is. For KohakuTPU:

| category | meaning | what falls here |
|---|---|---|
| **fixed protocol** | cannot be changed by a project | the mesh port's six signals and its retry flow control; the flit header; how an instruction arrives and a completion returns; the memory request/response protocol |
| **customizable addon** | ships working, meant to be swapped | **the MXFP7 quantiser** — KohakuTPU's number format plugged into the memory agent's transform stage ([number-format.md](number-format.md) §5); staging or an L2 in the same agent, if it is ever built ([notes/cache/](../../notes/cache/README.md)) |
| **convention** | how to design a thing — some forced by the agent's design, some free | operands stored tile-major so a fill is one instruction; K swept outermost inside a sweep and innermost across chunks; rounds cut against three limits at once; naming a memory primitive rather than inferring it |
| **yours** | the project's own, top to bottom | **almost everything else on these pages**: the number format, the DSP packing, the cascade, the accumulator and its tile, the vector ALU, both instruction sets, the compiler, the mesh populations |

**Most of KohakuTPU is in the last row, and saying so is what makes the framework
claim credible.** A framework that had dictated the datapath would not have needed
a project to prove anything.

## 4. Status

| | |
|---|---|
| matmul datapath | **built and verified** against both a behavioural model and a real DSP48E2 |
| accumulator | **built**, FP22, resident tile, peer transfer reachable |
| cluster as an endpoint | **built**, one mesh port, closes with margin |
| quantiser | **built**, on the memory-agent side, both read and upload paths |
| vector ALU | **built and measured** — correctly rounded FMA, faithful seeds |
| vector core around it | **built**, and its instruction set partly so |
| driver and hand-built encoders | **run on the card** |
| compiler path | cluster ops emit; **vector ops do not**, deliberately refused |
| tensor-descriptor ISA | designed, walker built and validated, **not wired in** |
| chain bypass, `FWD` | **not built** |
| split-K epilogue on a vector core | **designed, not built** |
| place-and-route on a populated die | **not done** for any cluster-count configuration |

Two open defects are recorded rather than hidden: **silent FP16 saturation** on
the way out of the accumulator ([accumulator.md](accumulator.md) §7), and **an L1
footprint band that returns wrong data**, currently guarded rather than fixed
([results.md](results.md) §9.1).

## 5. How to read the rest

The order below is the order the decisions were forced, and each page assumes the
one before it.

1. **[number-format.md](number-format.md)** — MXFP7. The format sets the operand
   width, which sets the packing, which sets the cascade depth, which sets the
   block size. Start here or nothing else will look motivated.
2. **[matmul.md](matmul.md)** — the tensor core: two int7 MACs per DSP sharing an
   activation through the pre-adder, the packing offset, the guard-bit budget, and
   the cascade that reduces K=32 without touching the fabric.
3. **[accumulator.md](accumulator.md)** — the resident output tile, why its size
   decides the port count, the reuse contract, and where floating point starts.
4. **[vector-core.md](vector-core.md)** — the second unit: E8M15 chosen so an FMA
   fits one DSP exactly, and four base-2 seeds at full rate.
5. **[isa.md](isa.md)** — one worked example of spending the framework's
   instruction payload bits, at three scales.
6. **[compiler.md](compiler.md)** — the software stack: three IR levels, tile
   choice discounted by padding, and the round-cutting a machine without hardware
   loops forces on its compiler.
7. **[ship.md](ship.md)** — the device, and why the machine is four meshes.
8. **[results.md](results.md)** — every measured number, with its conditions.

If you are here to see whether the framework would suit a different datapath,
read [integrate/](../../integrate/README.md) instead; these pages are specific on
purpose.

Forward-looking work that has not been decided lives in
[notes/](../../notes/README.md) — chiefly the staging and cache design space,
which is where the next structural decision about this machine will be made.
