# Specification

These documents are **normative**. A compute unit that satisfies everything
stated here works on the framework. One that does not, does not — the failure
mode is not a rejected build, it is a mesh that hangs or a tile that is quietly
wrong.

Everything here describes the framework. Where a choice belongs to
[KohakuTPU](../projects/kohakutpu/) — the reference accelerator built on it —
it is marked as **one example of spending a free field**, never as the contract.
A second accelerator may spend those fields differently and is still conformant.

For why the framework is shaped this way, read [arch/](../arch/). For how to
plug into it, read [integrate/](../integrate/). This tree tells you what the
bits are.

## Three kinds of statement, and you must know which you are reading

A reader of a specification has to know what they are **allowed** to violate.
Every statement in this tree is one of three kinds, and each is marked where it
appears.

| Kind | What it is | Can you change it? |
|---|---|---|
| **Fixed** | The protocol. Flit format, port handshake, memory request and response encoding, retry and credit, cross-mesh encapsulation. Anything stating a signal, a bit position or a handshake rule. | **No.** Change it and you are not on the framework any more. |
| **Addon** | A slot that ships working and exists to be swapped. The memory agent's transform stage, memory-agent-side staging, the endpoint's staging adapter. | **Yes** — that is what the slot is for. The interface around it is Fixed; what you put in it is not. |
| **Convention** | An idiom: a recommended layout, a tagging discipline, a way we did it. Instruction-bit budgets, unit-to-unit payload shapes, the local-buffer fill idiom. | **Yes.** Nothing checks it. Some are nonetheless *effectively binding* because the memory agent will hand you data in a particular shape whether or not you asked; each is labelled with which. |

Two rules follow, and they are on the authors of this tree rather than on you:

- A table **MUST NOT** mix kinds without a column that distinguishes them.
- A Convention **MUST** say in one line whether the memory agent forces it.

A reader who cannot tell the difference either violates a real contract or wastes
weeks obeying advice.

### What the framework does not specify at all

**Your compute unit is yours, its memory system included.** Nothing in this tree
fixes the width, count, primitive or read latency of a unit's local storage, and
nothing ever will. The two units in the reference project share none of it — one
holds operands in 928-bit-wide RAMs across five separate memories with two
different read latencies, the other in a single 256-bit RAM plus a separate
instruction memory in LUTs.

What is fully defined is **how you receive and how you send**: the port, the flit,
and the request/response encoding. Everything on your side of that boundary is a
design decision the framework declines to make.

The best worked example of the Fixed/Convention line inside one topic is
unit-to-unit transfer: the envelope is Fixed, the payload inside one mesh is
Convention, and the moment the transfer crosses a mesh boundary the whole thing
becomes Fixed — because the interlink has to encapsulate and route it, and it
cannot forward a shape it does not know. See
[memory-protocol.md](memory-protocol.md) §6.0 and §9.3.

## The documents

| Document | What it covers | Kinds inside |
|---|---|---|
| [compute-unit-port.md](compute-unit-port.md) | Every signal a compute unit presents, every obligation it meets, and everything it may never do. | Fixed throughout. §10 is illustration. |
| [flit-format.md](flit-format.md) | The 288-bit flit: header fields, bit positions, message types, per-type payload layouts, and who owns each field. | Fixed. One Convention pocket in §4.7.1. |
| [instruction-encoding.md](instruction-encoding.md) | The three owners of instruction bits, and the split inside `CU_INST`. | Fixed for the header and the memory descriptors; Convention for how a unit spends its own payload. |
| [memory-protocol.md](memory-protocol.md) | Request, response, descriptor and streaming traffic against the memory agent, plus the ordering guarantees and their absences. | Fixed for the encoding and ordering; one Addon (§10); several Conventions the agent forces (§3.2.3). |
| [control-registers.md](control-registers.md) | The `CU_CTRL` block every unit answers, and the orchestrator's AXI register map. | Fixed. |
| [parameters.md](parameters.md) | Every parameter of every framework module: type, default, effect, legal range. | Reference. |

## What to read, in what order

**Writing a compute unit — you MUST read:**

1. [compute-unit-port.md](compute-unit-port.md) in full. It is the contract.
2. [flit-format.md](flit-format.md) §1–§4 — the header and the type codes. Skip
   the per-type payload tables for message classes you do not send.
3. [instruction-encoding.md](instruction-encoding.md) — before you allocate a
   single instruction bit.
4. [memory-protocol.md](memory-protocol.md) §3–§5 and §7, if your unit reads or
   writes memory itself, and §3.2.3 in particular — it is the one place the
   agent's shape reaches into your design. §6 if your unit sends or receives
   `CU_DATA`, which includes every unit that is fed by another unit rather than
   by memory. §7 regardless: the ordering non-guarantees apply to everything.

**Lookup only, read when you need the number:**

- [control-registers.md](control-registers.md) — needed when you write the
  driver or the bring-up script, not when you write the datapath. The framework
  answers the `CU_CTRL` block on your behalf; §1.4 is the one part that reaches
  your logic.
- [parameters.md](parameters.md) — needed when you instantiate or floorplan.

## Conventions

**Normative language.** MUST and MUST NOT are absolute: violating one is a
protocol error, and the framework's behaviour afterwards is undefined. SHOULD
marks a requirement with known, stated exceptions. MAY marks a genuine choice
that the framework will not take away later.

**Bit numbering.** Verilog convention throughout: `[hi:lo]`, MSB first, bit 0 the
least significant. `f[255 -: 34]` is the 34 bits from 255 down to 222, which is
how the RTL writes it. Flit fields are given twice where they differ: once as an
expression in `FLIT_WIDTH` and `POS_WIDTH`, and once as the concrete positions at
the default `FLIT_WIDTH = 288`, `POS_WIDTH = 4`.

**Kind.** Sections and rows carry one of **Fixed**, **Addon** or **Convention**,
as defined above. An unmarked normative statement is Fixed.

**Ownership.** Every field is one of:

| Marking | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **framework** | The framework reads or writes it. A unit that repurposes it breaks routing, reassembly or dispatch. |
| **reserved** | Nothing reads it today. It MUST be transmitted as zero, so a later reader can be added without auditing every sender. |
| **unit** | Yours. The framework never inspects it, and never will without a revision of this spec. |

**No measurements.** No Fmax, LUT count or utilisation figure appears in this
tree. Those describe one accelerator on one part and live with the project that
produced them, in [projects/](../projects/).

## Where the source of truth is

The RTL is the source of truth and this tree is checked against it, not derived
from an earlier document. Where a header comment, `noc_pkt.vh` macro or the
pre-reframing snapshot in `kohaku_npu_docs/` disagrees with the silicon, the
silicon wins and the disagreement is recorded in the relevant document under
"Known divergences". Do not resolve one of those by reading the other file.
