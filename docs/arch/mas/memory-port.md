# The memory port

The server behind the instruction set, and the thing you add more of when the
machine stops scaling.

## A port is the unit the machine grows by

The read engine fetches one entry at a time. With a single engine, every compute
unit in the mesh queues behind one state machine and one emit buffer. That was
the constraint that stopped the reference machine scaling — and it stopped while
nothing was saturated, which is the diagnostic: the limit was the *server*, not
the bandwidth.

So a **memory port** is a whole server: its own intake queues, read engine,
transform, write slots, response emitter, and its own AXI master channel.
`MEM_PORTS` of them are instantiated, and adding one adds all of it. Nothing is
shared between ports except the address space on the far side of AXI.

The ports sit at **different mesh nodes**, and that is not a placement
preference. Routing is X-then-Y on clamped coordinates, so a port at `(0, y)`
draws traffic to router `(GRID_LO, y)` and to no other. Two ports on the same
router would split the server and leave the funnel — the link into that router —
exactly as narrow as before.

## Intake: backpressure must not depend on content

`mem_in_busy` is computed from this port's own queue occupancy and nothing else.
It never depends on what the arriving flit is.

The reason is that the mesh is in-order behind a busy signal. If a port decides
"busy" because it cannot classify or accept *this particular* flit, everything
behind that flit stops too — including, in the general case, the flit that would
have freed the resource. Deciding from local state only makes the condition
self-clearing.

Two queues sit behind that one busy signal, demultiplexed by type: reads in one,
write descriptors and write data in the other. With a single queue, a read
request at the head that cannot be taken blocks the write data behind it — and
that data is exactly what lets a drain finish. Busy is still "is there room in
both", which is still local state, so the hazard above does not come back.

## Reads: the response says where it belongs

The engine turns a request into consecutive AXI reads. When a **run** is
requested, the next entry's address is issued the moment the current entry's
last beat lands, not after the transform has finished with it — that overlaps
the address-to-first-beat latency, which would otherwise be paid once per entry.
The address is accumulated rather than computed as `base + n * size`, because a
runtime multiply lands directly in the address path.

A finished entry is latched into an **emit buffer** before it is sent, so the
next entry's AXI read can start immediately. Without the buffer, the transform's
output registers *are* the emit source, so fetch and emit exclude each other and
two independent interfaces run at the sum of their times instead of the larger.

Every response flit is self-describing. Its transaction tag is the requester's
own tag plus this entry's position in the run, and the word index within the
entry rides in the header's spare bits. The receiver therefore needs no cursor,
and arrival order stops being load-bearing. **That is what makes a streaming
fetch possible at all** — one request, hundreds of cycles of traffic, and a
receiver that can bin every flit it gets without tracking where it is.

**Extra destinations** exist because many compute units frequently want the same
bytes. Without them the transform runs once per consumer for a bit-identical
result. With them, the same latched words are re-sent with a different header:
no second AXI read, no second pass of the transform.

## Writes: slots matched by source, not by arrival order

A write is a descriptor flit and then data flits, and the mesh may put another
node's flit between them. Collecting "the next flit" into the open write is
therefore wrong the moment two units write at once.

Each source gets a **slot**, matched by source coordinate. A slot holds a whole
burst, because one burst's beats must be contiguous on AXI while the mesh
interleaves data flits freely. A slot walks `val -> rdy -> iss -> free`, and all
three bits are needed: with only `val` and `rdy`, a slot whose write is on the
bus is indistinguishable from one still waiting for its data, and the next data
flit from that source binds to the in-flight slot.

Slot count is a correctness parameter, not a performance one. A unit that
discards its write ack — which it should, they are fire-and-forget — sends its
next descriptor while the previous burst is still on the bus. With one slot per
unit, the second descriptor finds nothing free, is never popped, and blocks the
data flits behind it that would have freed one. **Under-sizing does not corrupt
anything; it deadlocks.**

## Reads and writes run alongside each other

A streaming fetch occupies the read path for its entire run. If it ran inside
the same state machine as the write path, that machine never returns to idle, so
no write slot can be issued: the slots fill, intake jams on a write descriptor
nothing will accept, and the data flit behind it reports "no open write".
Lengthening one transaction starves the other. The read engine therefore has its
own state and its own return context, and shares only the single output register
— where the emitter wins, and cannot starve the write path because a few
response flits per entry against a fetch of several beats leaves most cycles
free.

## Conventions

This is the system that forces the most on a compute unit, because **the memory
agent hands you data in a shape whether you like it or not.** Four of these are
not really optional; the rest are advice with a reason.

**Accept words in the shape they arrive.** *(Forced.)* A response is N words per
entry, each carrying its entry's index within the run and its word index within
the entry. Your fill logic has to consume that. You are free to store it however
you like — the reference project's two units store it into memories of 928 and
256 bits respectively — but the *arrival* shape is not yours to choose.

**Bin by tag; do not build a cursor.** *(Forced.)* Responses are self-describing
precisely so that arrival order need not be tracked, and a streaming fetch does
not guarantee the order a cursor would assume. A receiver written against
arrival order works until the first time two runs overlap.

**Fetches are entry-granular.** *(Forced.)* A run is consecutive entries at a
fixed stride. If your natural line size is not the entry size, either set the
entry-words field or rearrange the region with the mover — but do not expect the
memory agent to slice differently per request.

**Discard write acks.** *(Forced.)* Slot sizing assumes you do not wait. A unit
that waits for its ack before sending the next descriptor is correct but slow;
a unit that waits *and* the slot count was sized for a unit that does not is how
you get an under-sized slot array and a deadlock.

**Store operands so that a pass is one contiguous run.** *(Free, but streaming
only pays off if you follow it.)* The reference driver stores tile-major for
exactly this reason. Scattered entries turn one streaming request into many
single-entry ones, and the per-request overhead is then paid per entry.

**Name extra destinations rather than issuing identical requests.** *(Free.)* If
several units want the same bytes, the fetch and the transform happen once
instead of once per consumer. Ignoring this is correct and wasteful, and the
waste scales with unit count.

## What a port costs

**Per memory port.** Two flit-wide intake FIFOs. The write slot array — a small
register file of per-slot state indexed by source, plus a data array of
`WR_SLOTS x WBURST` beats. The read engine's emit buffer, a few beat-wide
registers. One AXI master channel. Whatever the transform costs, once.

The slot data array is the part that grows fastest, since it is
`WR_SLOTS * WBURST * DATA_W` bits and both factors are sized for correctness
rather than tuned. Two structural choices keep the logic around it cheap: a
per-slot "the next beat is the last" term is precomputed from registered state
only, so the ready decision is a 1-bit select rather than mux-then-add-then-
compare; and free / match / pick are three separate priority scans over the slot
array rather than one scan with conditions, so none of them lands in the other's
path.

Intake FIFO primitive choice is a genuine trade, not a default. Block RAM saves
LUTs and costs frequency, because the worst path already starts at that FIFO's
output and a block RAM's clock-to-out is far slower than a LUTRAM's. Which side
to take depends on which resource the instance is short of.

What the rest of the system costs — the control agent's RAMs and the interlink —
is in [edge-and-control](edge-and-control.md#what-the-rest-costs).
