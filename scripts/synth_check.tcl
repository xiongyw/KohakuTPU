# arguments on '=', and powershell -File splits a string argument on ','. Both
# forms are rebuilt here in Tcl, where nothing is splitting anything.
#
# Out-of-context because the question is about the module's own logic depth, not
# about placement in a full design. The number it produces is therefore optimistic
# for a large mesh -- 196 routers plus their interconnect will not hold the same
# WNS as one router alone. Treat it as an upper bound and a way to catch a design
# that cannot possibly make the target, not as a sign-off.
