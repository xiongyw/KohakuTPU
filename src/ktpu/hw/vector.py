"""Vector-core machine code, and the CU instructions that carry it to a node.

`docs/isa/vector.md` §2 is the 32-bit instruction word; `vec_cu.v`'s header
comment is the 256-bit CU_INST payload that loads and runs one. Two encodings,
one file, because neither is useful without the other:

    IMEM  [255:252]=1  [251:243] addr   [31:0] word
    DESC  [255:252]=2  [251:249] ad     [248:246] fld   [245:212] value
    RUN   [255:252]=3  [251:243] start pc

A vector kernel is therefore a list of ordinary CU instructions -- the agent
stages and kicks them exactly as it stages a GEMM -- and `Kernel.flits` is the
whole translation.

FIELD WIDTHS ARE CHECKED. An oversized value shifts every field below it and
still produces a legal-looking word, which the core then decodes as some other
instruction; that is the one failure this encoding cannot report on its own.

PEER TRANSFERS, AND WHAT THE HOST CAN SEE OF THEM. `vdrain(..., node=(x, y))`
sends L1 to another CU instead of to memory, and `signal_on_complete` has the
receiver answer `SIG_DATA_RECEIVED`. That answer goes to the DESCRIPTOR'S
SOURCE:

* host -> CU, the source is the orchestrator (the dispatcher stamps it), so the
  ack lands in `NODE_STATUS[receiver]` and `Session.push_l1` waits on it.
* CU -> CU, the source is the SENDING CU, and nothing there consumes an ack --
  `vec_cu` drops any flit that is neither a read response nor `CU_DATA`. So the
  descriptor carries an ACK DESTINATION at `[215:208]` = ``{ack_y, ack_x}``,
  and a peer drain points it at the orchestrator. Zero means the source, which
  is what every host-originated burst uses and is unambiguous because `(0,0)`
  is a mesh corner and can never hold an endpoint.

For a `VDRAIN` the ack destination rides in the DESCRIPTOR'S BASE at `[23:16]`,
because the instruction word has one bit left and the base is 34 bits of which
a peer drain uses sixteen. So `desc(ad, base, dim(1, n))` with
``base = ack_y << 20 | ack_x << 16 | peer_l1_word``.

`VHALT` still means the flits were SENT, not landed -- `vec_core` waits on
`pipe_empty` and `fill_out`, neither of which knows a drain exists. The ack is
what tells the host the data arrived; the payload never leaves the mesh.
