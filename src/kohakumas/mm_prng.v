// Philox-4x32-10: a counter-based PRNG, one round per cycle.
//
// docs/memory-mover/prng.md s3. Counter-based and stateless, so the value is a
// pure function of (key, counter) -- which is what makes noise independent of
// how a region was tiled, restartable after a fault, and parallelisable by
// handing each lane a different counter. A stateful LFSR has none of those and
// would make a scheduling change look like a numerical bug.
//
// ITERATIVE, NOT UNROLLED. Ten rounds unrolled is twenty 32x32 multiplies in
// one path; at four cycles per round it is two, reused, for 40 cycles per 128
// bits. A 128x128x4 FP16 latent is 4096 256-bit words, so a full draw is 8192
// outputs -- 328k cycles, 1.1 ms at 300 MHz, against a UNet step measured in
// tens of ms. A few percent, and the first lever if it ever matters is a
// second generator, not a shorter round.
//
// Philox is chosen over Threefry because the constraint here is FABRIC, not
// multipliers: the vector core extrapolates to ~37% of an SLR's LUTs against
// 12.5% of its DSPs (compute/vector-core.md s13). Threefry is the ARX design
// that trades multipliers for rounds, which is why XLA prefers it on TPU.
